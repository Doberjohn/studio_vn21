    content: `Mary lay on the immaculate bed, holding her blood-stained pillow so tight, it could break; had it been made of solid material. She never thought she would live long enough to look her cruel husband in the eye and fight back. Chris had been beating her physically and emotionally for so many years she had lost count.

But today might be the end of the road for both of them. Marry had already called the police and knew Chris was minutes away from returning home. Standing up to him for the first time in her life was the bravest thing she had done since they married. She didn't do it when her nose bled for the first time, nor was when she was admitted to the hospital, despite the police's organized efforts to press charges. She didn't even think of doing it when she lost the twins.

But this time was different. No second thoughts, no fear, no looking back to the neatly packed clothes in the suitcases. The moment he turned the keys in the keyhole and opened the front door, she knew she was leaving this place either dead or alive.

"Hey, honey! I'm home!" he called.

Mary grabbed the heavy suitcases and headed for the living room. As soon as their eyes met, she felt her blood going cold. He glanced at her luggage and calmly asked, "What's that baby? Where are you going?"

"I'm leaving, Chris," she rushed to answer, almost interrupting him, "I'm leaving you for good. I can't take this anymore."
"What? No! Come to your senses, baby. I promised it would never happen again!" he said as he walked towards her.

Mary didn't take a single step back; she was really proud of that.

"How many more oaths do you intend on breaking, huh?" Police are on the way; I have told them everything. What they find when they arrive is now up to you. Next to you, I have lost everything I ever cared for. My friends, my dignity, my babies. All because I made the mistake of choosing you. You are the same horrible man as your father. As your uncle and the rest of your disgusting family."

Chris was shocked and speechless; he never thought his wife would find the strength to speak up for herself, pouring such harsh and sad words out of her mouth.

"I'm not afraid of you. You wanna know why? The worst things that could happen to me have already happened. You used to insult me, beat me, humiliate me. Right now, you might as well kill me. But for once in your life, act out of mercy and treat me as a human being. Give me what was never given to you, a choice. Let me walk out of this fucking door on my own two feet. Can you do that?"

Chris looked deep into her eyes in a last effort to reach her soul and connect with her. But what he saw left him disturbed and uncomfortable. All the pain and fear he caused had crystallized in her tired face. He stepped aside, clearing the way to the exit door. After regaining his composure, he found little strength to whisper a subtle "I'm sorry." Whether it was loud enough for her to hear it is something he will never know.

    content: `Talia leaned her forehead against the glass, the chill seeping into her skin as she watched hovercars drift between towers like fireflies trapped in a jar. Seventy-five floors up, the city pulsed below in streaks of violet and ember-orange. From here, it looked almost beautiful. When she was a child, floor thirty-nine had no windows. Just recycled air, soft mildew, and the low electrical hum of a dozen lives stacked too close.

Back then, she used to stare at the elevator map in the corridor. The numbers blinked up into the seventies and beyond, unreachable digits she treated like constellations. Mythical. Remote. She hadn’t known what was up there, only that it wasn’t grease, or ration coupons, or parents who never stopped coughing.

Now, she was here.

The elevator had opened with a hiss and a soft tone announcing her arrival: “Welcome to Elevate Legal Associates.” The lobby smelled of ionized air and synthetic cedar. Marble underfoot, chrome along the trim. No dust. No scuffs. No noise, except the delicate tapping of holo-keys from half-invisible interns cocooned in soft white light.

She passed them with her briefcase clutched too tight. It was secondhand. She’d buffed the scratches out the night before, not perfectly.

Her name was already etched on her office door in silver. Talia Quen. Junior Legal Analyst. She stood there for a moment, waiting to feel something like triumph. But all she felt was the faint pressure of the collar around her neck. She adjusted it. Smiled at no one.

The office was colder than she expected. Floor-to-ceiling glass on two sides. No privacy, no clutter, just a desk, a chair, a data port, and a single potted plant. Synthetic, of course. The leaves were too perfect to be real.

She sat. Logged in. The AEA onboarding packet had told her this would be a high-autonomy, high-efficiency position. Her first assignment blinked in her inbox. Draft review of Motion 349-V: AI-Personhood Rhetoric Limits (Media Offenses Section). Due by end of shift.

She skimmed. Dense language. Legal scaffolding that barely touched human concerns. Her fingers hovered over the interface.

Instead, she looked out the window again.

Thirteen years ago, an AEA scanner had flagged her at school. Mathematical processing in the 99.7th percentile. Cognitive elasticity "above system norms." She hadn’t known what those numbers meant, only that the next day a woman in a silver coat had come to their apartment, smiled at her parents, and explained things too quickly and too cleanly.

After that, the textbooks changed. They came with seals. With lockouts. With auto-reporting modules that sent alerts when she missed a deadline. At fourteen, she was commuting to floors she wasn’t supposed to live on, wearing shoes her parents couldn’t afford, sitting in rooms where no one looked like her or smelled like home.

The higher she climbed, the quieter her world became.

A polite knock at the door startled her. She turned too fast.

A woman stepped in, tall, serene, in slate-gray. Probably mid-level counsel. Her smile was frictionless.

"Welcome," the woman said. "I'm Senior Analyst Hira. Just checking in. Settling alright?"

Talia stood. "Yes. Thank you."

"Good. Don’t hesitate to ask questions. We're a team here." Hira’s gaze slid over the room. “We’ve been watching your ascent for years.”

That word. Ascent.
It made her stomach curl.

Hira left without waiting for a reply.

By midday, Talia had written six paragraphs and deleted seven. The city outside remained in motion, but somehow suspended. Hovercars drifting like it was all for show. From this high up, the streets didn’t seem real.

She thought of her mother’s fingers, always stained with sealant. Her father’s coughing fits behind the curtain at night. Their silence when the first scholarship notice came. Their soft attempts to celebrate something they could never visit.

She wondered if they’d even seen this tower from the ground.

When the shift ended, the system blinked: 18:00. Productivity Report Submitted. She closed the holo-screen.

Before leaving, she touched the edge of the glass window again, forehead grazing the cold. Hovercars passed. Towers blinked. Below, the city writhed in its own quiet rhythm.

The lights on floor thirty-nine would be dim by now. Air thin. Rooms humid. She imagined the smell of soap that never quite masked machine oil.

And she thought, strangely, sharply, not of pride.
But of absence.`,

The weather today has been excellent. In the afternoon, I went for a walk in the gardens with Ms. Keyes. She insisted we play that silly game that you know I hate. If you had been here, maybe she would not do that. Then we had some potatoes for dinner, it was very tasty. Father said they were “heaven-sent.” But Ms. Keyes did not agree. Yes, she had dinner with us; I know you do not approve, but Father insisted. He seems to feel that now you are away, I should have a female companion here at all times.

Anyway, how is grandmamma? I hear the weather in Marseilles is sunny and warm this time of year. This ought to help with her health issues. Please convey my heartfelt sympathy. I want her to get much better much sooner so that you can return to us. Father and I both miss you terribly, mama.

Your daughter,

He’d hunted vampires for years on end. A life of bloodshed was his only friend.

But on this night, fate had a different plan; a priest stumbled upon the hunter’s land. The priest carried a symbol of holy grace and begged the hunter to guide him to a vampire’s place.

The hunter scoffed at the priest’s request and warned him of the danger that lay ahead. But the priest refused to back down and flee, and so the hunter reluctantly agreed.

As they journeyed through the darkened trees, the hunter heard patiently the priest’s beliefs. His faith in the divine, his devotion to prayer, it made the hunter question what he held dear.

The priest spoke of forgiveness and love, ideals the hunter had never thought of. His heart began to soften, his eyes to see the beauty of life beyond just killing for fees.

And as they finally reached the vampire’s lair, the hunter realized how much he did care. For the priest’s life, for his newfound friend, he fought the vampire until the very end.

The battle was long, and the struggle was fierce; the vampire was powerful and had nothing to fear. But the hunter fought with all his might and ultimately emerged victorious in the fight.

But in the end, as they fled the scene, the hunter revealed that he was stabbed and was losing steam. He knew his time was coming to an end, but he didn’t care, for he had found his first real friend.

The priest held the hunter’s hand as he died, and whispered a prayer for his soul to abide. And as the hunter’s spirit began to depart, he smiled, knowing he had a change of heart.

For in the end, it wasn’t just about killing the beast, it was about finding a new way to live in peace. And though he may have died in the end, the hunter knew he had found an ally and friend.`,

He had worked in this lab for more than ten years, by now, it was like his second home. The work he did was sacred, important. He could have saved lives if his research was completed.

All those years of looking for a cure, of the terrible disease that plagued our kind. His team and colleagues worked day and night, but his company demanded results which he did not provide.

The government finally decided to pull the research plug, and his employer declined his request for more funds. They gave him one month to pack all his things, and say his goodbyes to his beloved team.

The final day arrived, and he is the last one to leave. Like a loyal captain refusing to abandon the sinking ship. He looked back for one last time what he saw made him sad, as his second home now resembled a dystopian lab.`,

After years of misfortune, and a great deal of pain, people talked about their options, how the monsters they could slay.

The next year this dreaded night, in the town’s main square, came a black cat named Midnight, with green eyes that would glare.

People thought she was a monster, in their houses got locked up. On the empty streets, she wandered, without even looking back.

She went straight into the forest, Little time she had left, as the cursed night drew closer, Midnight had to be quite deft.

Just in time, she finds the portal, that was created years ago, and would open on The Great Moon, allowing monsters to come through.

Her green eyes started pulsing, her slim body to transform, as Midnight started casting, a spell in her human form.

The Disciples of Evil, gave it all and fought like hell. In the end, though, they were no match, for Midnight’s powerful spell.

The cat’s quest was now completed, And the peace had been restored, and The Night of the Monsters could harm no one anymore.

No one saw her from that day, Cause she never came back, but Midnight became a legend, as their lives got back on track.`,

    content: `It’s 23:32, and Adam has been sleeping for three hours. Suddenly, amidst the darkness, a low-tone whispering voice echoes.

“Wakey, wakey, Mr.Black. It’s time for tonight’s guessing game.”

As he slowly opens his eyes, Adam takes a moment to let these eerie words echo in his mind and reflect back to the shadows where they came from.

Still half awake, half asleep, Adam slowly stands up from the bed shouting back at the mirror,

“Alright, I am coming, alright. Today I am going to beat you, you know.”

“I hope so, Mr.Black. You still have a lot of work to do if you want to beat me in our little game. So please, get up, and come to me. You have to make a new guess tonight.”, the mirror answered as he laughed sarcastically.

Adam glances at the beautiful landscape around him. The view is stunning, as always, but it’s the climate he never liked, especially the air. The air is freezing most of the year, and Adam prefers warmer temperatures. Not that it mattered much, considering he couldn’t leave home whenever he wanted.

He could only go out at specific hours of the day and spend time with his friends, but they had to stick strictly to the schedule of the neighborhood so that everyone had fun. He’s been living in this new house for five years. One could say that it’s a lot of time, but he did it to be sure that no one could move him out of this cozy, spacy residence.

He moves towards the sink in the bathroom, right next to where his bed is. As he washes his face, the subtle but creepy and a bit disturbing voice speaks again. This time it is heard through the mirror right above his head.

“I hope you had plenty of sleep, Mr.Black. Today’s reveal is going to be special. I want you to be well-rested and prepared for what’s to come.”

“I am not afraid of you, mirror. I am scared of nothing. I never was.”

“Oh, and how did that work for you? You are stuck with me for the rest of your life, playing ‘Guess who’ every night.”

Adam raises his head and looks straight into the mirror. But he can’t see his reflection. He can only see a floating black shadow, like a mass without form or identity.

“What do you see?” the mirror asked.

“I see a shadow. A big, black shadow inside you.”, Adam answered without hesitating.

“But I am you, and you are I. That shadow is rooted deep inside you. And you are, once more, not ready to face the truth. So, make a guess. Who am I today?”

Adam’s blood went cold for a second. He tried to compose himself and spoke again. “You are Mrs.Barbara Peterson. That old hag lived on the third floor, right above my apartment, back when I was living in London. She and her stupid, lousy cats.”

Suddenly, the black mass inside the mirror starts disappearing, and the beautiful figure of an old woman takes its place. She is holding a few baby cats and smiling at Adam.

After a few seconds of silence, the mirror says, “Ah, yes, Mrs.Barbara. Poor, Mrs.Barbara. I remember her. A day came when all of her children went their ways and left her alone. Noone came back for her; Everyone forgot her. To fight her loneliness, she adopted six little kittens to keep her company till the end of her time. But you couldn’t stand the noise, could you?”

“What are you talking about?”

“She used to love you, remember? She always greeted you with a big, warm smile. But you couldn’t stand her smile, so you killed her.”

“No. No. You are lying. I couldn’t. I am no murderer. Yes, I couldn’t stand her or her stupid cats, but I can’t hurt anyone.

“Yes, you can, and yes, you are a murderer. A cold-blooded killer. You went upstairs to her apartment one day and pretended you wanted to pay the rent.”

“Stop it! Stop, please!”

“She let you in her house. She thought of you as a friend of hers. She felt that you loved her as much as she loved you. But you did not. You can’t love or be loved, Mr.Black, because you are empty!”

“No! Stop!”

“And then you saw the kittens on the couch. Too much noise, you thought and headed straight for the kitchen. You grabbed a knife and stabbed Mrs.Barbara 20 times to her death.”

“There was so much noise! So much noise!”

The mirror pauses for a moment. Now dropped to his knees, Adam is holding his head tightly, trying to silence the voices of hundreds of people inside his head.

“Do you hear them now? Those are the voices of the hundreds of lives you took before Mrs.Barbara. Together, we go through that every night. Meeting them one by one.”

“No! How could I?”

“This is your final lesson. Now admit it.”

Adam still holds his head, trying to make the screams disappear. But they only grow louder.

“Look at me!” the thundering echo of the mirror is enough to make any voice in Adam’s head go away. He rises and looks in the mirror one more time.

“You see, Mrs.Barbara was your last mistake. In your rage and despair, you set her apartment on fire but didn’t disappear. No, you stayed there and watched. That’s how they found you and brought you here, to me. After five years of mindless murders, the police had finally caught the notorious serial killer.”

Adam looks around, and a staggering pain pierces his cold heart.

“That’s right. Nothing is beautiful around here. No landscapes, no friends, no cozy house. This prison cell will be your home till the end of your time. Now tell me. Who are you?”

Adam mumbles and whispers his name as he starts to realize what his true nature is.

“I am Adam Black.”

“What are you?”

“A serial killer.”

“Take a look at me for one last time. And give an end to this. You deserve to be alone, forever, in this cell.”

He looks at the mirror for one last time. But for the first time, he can see his face, crystal clear, reflected on the dirty, ugly piece of glass. And with one swift strike, he punches the mirror and breaks it into hundreds of tiny pieces, like the voices inside his head.

The blood on his fist brings back sad memories of mistakes he will never be able to fix. And with that thought, he returns to his cold bed.`,

    content: `The moon was crystal clear on this eerie Halloween night, casting an orange glow across the deserted pumpkin patch. Two pumpkins sat side by side, watching as the last trick-or-treaters disappeared into the night.

“Jack, do you ever wonder what happens to the pumpkins after Halloween?” she asked timidly.

Jack just chuckled, his voice sounding like nails on a chalkboard. “Don’t be silly, Lily. We’re just pumpkins. Our purpose is to be carved, put on display, and then discarded. That’s all there is to it.”

But Lily couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. As the night grew darker, she began to notice strange sounds coming from the pumpkin patch. A rustling in the leaves, a distant howling, and something else…something that sounded like a low growl.

“Jack, I’m scared,” Lily whimpered. “I think we should try to leave.”

But Jack just laughed at her. “Where do you think we’re going to go, little pumpkin? We’re stuck here until someone decides to return and dispose of us.”

Suddenly, there was a loud, piercing scream that echoed across the patch. Lily jumped in terror, but Jack remained unmoved.

“Relax, Lily,” he said calmly. “It’s just a trick-or-treater playing a prank.”

But as the night wore on, the sounds grew more terrifying. Lily could hear scratching at the ground beneath her, and she felt a cold breeze blowing through the patch.

“Jack, something’s not right,” she whispered. “I don’t think we’re alone out here.”

Just then, a shadowy figure appeared in the distance. Lily gasped as she realized it was a scarecrow with a burlap sack over its head and a pitchfork in its hand.

“Jack, look!” she cried, pointing toward the figure.

But Jack just laughed again. “That’s just old Farmer Joe’s scarecrow,” he said. “It’s been there for years. It’s not going to hurt us.”

But Lily wasn’t convinced. As the scarecrow approached, she could see that its burlap sack was stained with dark red stains. And then, as it passed by them, she caught a whiff of a horrible, rotten smell.

“Jack, we need to get out of here!” she yelled, but it was too late. The scarecrow had heard her, and it turned towards them with a low growl.

In the darkness, Lily could see that its eyes were glowing red. Its mouth twisted into a menacing grin, and it raised the pitchfork high into the air.

Lily screamed as the scarecrow lunged toward them. She felt the sharp points of the pitchfork pierce her flesh, and then everything went black.

The next morning, Farmer Joe came to check on his pumpkin patch. But he was horrified to find that two pumpkins had been destroyed. Their faces had been carved into twisted expressions of terror, and blood and guts spilled everywhere.

No one ever discovered what had happened to Jack and Lily that night. But some say that on Halloween if you listen closely, you can still hear their screams echoing through the pumpkin patch…

    content: `Ever since I finished school, time started moving faster. Weeks, months, gone in the blink of an eye. I belong to the adult world for the last fifteen years. It’s a place that, in its own blunt and clumsy way, forces you to wonder where you were born and why. In this hyperactive society, lucky is the person who has enough time to ponder upon the why of the matter, even as a fleeting thought that comes and goes. 

Even luckier the one that tries to decipher this conjunction. I truly believe each of us was born with a destiny, each of us with a unique gene that helps us fulfil a personal or collective goal. Our point of departure in life is to discover and define our destiny, our purpose, call it what you want. The absence of this point torments many, not necessarily consciously. We’ve moved away from the correct translation of our genes in this harsh and demanding society. 

I used to believe that the answer to “why” is this: whoever can find their purpose in this shitty world and starts working towards fulfilling it would have the answer. Then, they would feel complete. It grieves me to say that those who managed to not only find but also fulfil their purpose did not get the results they yearned for. I am one of these people, who, though young, managed to accomplish part of his goals and this led me to an unequivocal conclusion. Human beings are greedy for everything: material and spiritual goods, pure romantic feelings, carnal pleasure. We want more. Always more. Life may give us these things generously but we still wouldn’t feel complete. 

Many will say that this is good, it gives you the motivation to keep going and set new goals. I agree completely, but first you have to answer this primeval “why”. Otherwise, you’re on steps that keep going up, never ending, never seeing the light at the top of the staircase. The purpose, the goal, the dream is a personal matter. The answer can’t be as simple as becoming a doctor, a lawyer, a fuckboy, a serial drinker and smoker. The question, the infamous “why”, doesn’t let you personalize your answer; it has to be common for everyone. An answer universal, romantic and at the same time cynical.

I live because I was born. I was born to live. An answer that might not help anyone at all, but it’s a start for me.`,

    content: `It’s Halloween night. The kids are eating their candy while humorously discussing their trick-or-treat experience. The living room is messy and full of chocolate wraps and pumpkin heads. Their mother, Olivia, is dancing to the rhythm of the music on the radio, waiting for the pie to get ready. She looks happy. This is the first thing that George notices about his wife.

Everyone is having a great time. Except for him. What if the man comes back? Should he call the police? His hands are trembling as he feels cold sweat running down his back. His daughter, Emma, approaches and offers him her cookie. George tries to fake a smile and caresses her hair. He takes a small bite and puts it on the plate in front of him.

“Hey, George!” Olivia shouts as she puts a cigarette in her mouth. George looks at her and smiles as she blows him a kiss. She keeps dancing with his mother-in-law. He clenches his jaw. He can’t just ruin the mood of the party. He feels the paintings on the walls staring at him. Suddenly, a shadow outside the window catches his eye. George stands up and starts going there.

The weather is windy. He can notice tiny rain droplets on the leaves of Olivia’s flowers that adorn their small veranda. Suddenly, a man who is drenched in blood hits his hands on the window and screams, “Help me!” George stomps back and knocks off the vase behind him. Olivia runs to him and grabs him by his shoulders. “Are you okay? What happened?” she asks as she tries to calm him down. George takes deep breaths and shakes his head. “Everything’s fine, my love.” The kids have stopped talking, and everyone is looking at him. “Guys, relax! I just got scared by Ms. Anna’s cat.”

George starts laughing nervously, claps his hands, and gets closer to the table as he pours a glass of whiskey and drinks it as fast as possible. Olivia stares at him but gets distracted by the oven sound. She clears her throat and goes to the kitchen. George turns up the radio volume while Olivia brings the pie to the table and starts serving each family member. In a moment, George looks up and notices that the man he saw a few minutes ago is staring at him by the other window of the living room. He decides to keep quiet. The man touches the glass gently and mouths the words “Help me” again. George looks down as his eyes start to get teary. His daughter grabs his hand to calm him down. He smiles at her and nods his head.

Suddenly, the doorbell rings. Emma runs to the door and opens it. Their aunt, Martha, comes inside. “You can’t believe what I just witnessed!” Martha takes off her coat, and Olivia helps her to put it in the closet. “Did your kids pull another prank on you?” Olivia laughs but gets caught by Martha’s expression. “I wish!” Martha sits next to George and kisses her brother on the cheek. “As I was driving to get here, I saw two parked police cars and tons of people standing on the street near George’s store.”

George’s eyes widen as he hears these words. “They told me someone hit a man with his car and didn’t stop to help him. He is dead, obviously!” George feels like he is ready to throw up. He stands up and runs to the bathroom. He throws water on his face. Suddenly, he feels a hand touching his back. George starts shaking as he hears the exact words again and again. “Help me! Please help me!” He starts crying. George turns around and realizes that it’s Olivia. He can understand by her look that she knows. He is afraid. What is going to happen? Olivia hugs him, but she is already gone when he tries to put his arms around her. George is now in the bathroom, shocked but not alone. The man is always going to be there.`,

She shouldn't be here. The Enchanted Grove was forbidden. A place spoken of only in whispers among the elder mages. But the dreams had been relentless, calling her deeper into the wilderness with each passing night.

When she finally found it, the grove took her breath away. Trees older than memory formed a perfect circle, their branches interlocking overhead to create a cathedral of living wood. In the center, a pool of water reflected not the sky above, but something else entirely. Other worlds, other times.

Lyra stepped forward, her heart pounding. As her fingers touched the water's surface, the grove blazed with light. Ancient runes appeared on every tree trunk, pulsing with power that had slept for a thousand years.

"Welcome, Lyra," a voice echoed from everywhere and nowhere. "We have been waiting."

She turned, staff raised, but there was no one there. Only the trees, the water, and the overwhelming sense that her life had just changed forever. The grove had chosen her, and there was no turning back now.`,

This was his last case. Tomorrow, he'd hand in his badge after thirty years on the force. But tonight, he had one more mystery to solve. One that had haunted him for a decade.

The Phantom of Baker Street, they called the killer. Five victims over ten years, all found in the same alley, all with the same cryptic message carved into the pavement beside them: "The truth hides in plain sight."

Raymond had studied every detail, followed every lead, and come up empty every time. But tonight felt different. Tonight, he'd received an anonymous tip, an address on Baker Street, a time, and a single word: "Watch."

The clock struck midnight. A figure emerged from the apartment building, umbrella in hand, walking with purpose toward the alley. Raymond's breath caught. He recognized that walk, that silhouette.

It couldn't be. But as the figure stepped into the light of a streetlamp, Raymond's world shattered. Some truths, he realized, were better left in shadow.`,

"Dear Wednesday," it began. That's what they called each other, days of the week, pseudonyms to keep the magic alive.

She didn't know his name, his face, or his voice. But through these letters, she knew his soul. He loved old movies, hated artificial strawberry flavor, and dreamed of sailing around the world. He made her laugh with terrible puns and made her think with profound questions about life and happiness.

Emma pulled out her own letter, carefully crafted over the past week, and left it under the sugar bowl. She ordered her usual coffee and watched the sunset paint the ocean in shades of gold and pink.

What she didn't see was the man who walked in five minutes after she left. He had kind eyes and a sailor's tan, and he smiled when he found her letter waiting.

What neither of them knew was that they rode the same bus every morning, sat in adjacent booths every Wednesday, and had been looking for each other in all the wrong places.

Sometimes love is patient. Sometimes it's already here, waiting for us to turn around.`,

Earth had gone silent in 2087, right in the middle of humanity's first interstellar colonization mission. No warning, no explanation. Just... silence. Sarah and her crew had debated turning back, but they were already past the point of no return. They'd continued to Proxima Centauri, established the colony, and Sarah had volunteered to make the return journey.

Relativity was a cruel thing. For her, only ten years had passed. For Earth? Fifty.

That's why her heart nearly stopped when ARIA announced: "Incoming transmission from Earth."

"That's impossible," Sarah whispered, but she was already moving to the communications deck.

The message was audio only, crackling with static but unmistakably human. A young woman's voice, speaking words that made Sarah's blood run cold:

"To anyone listening: We made it. We survived. But we're not the same. If you're out there, if you can hear this, don't come back. Earth is home, but it's not yours anymore. We've... changed. Evolved. You wouldn't understand. You wouldn't be safe."

The message ended. Sarah stared at the speaker, her hands trembling.

ARIA's calm voice broke the silence: "Commander, we're still three months from Earth. What are your orders?"

Sarah took a deep breath. Some questions, she realized, could only be answered by going forward into the unknown.`,

"Clara... Clara..."

She told herself it was grief. Grandmother had only been gone two weeks. The mind played tricks when you were alone in a house full of memories.

But then she found the room.

It wasn't on any floor plan. Just a door in the hallway that she could have sworn wasn't there before. Inside, journals filled floor-to-ceiling shelves. All in her grandmother's handwriting. All dated from before Clara was born.

She opened the first one randomly:

"It spoke to me again today. The house. It wants another one. I've kept it fed for so long, but it's getting hungry. Getting bold. I think it knows about Clara. I think it's been waiting for her since the day she was born."

Clara dropped the journal, her heart racing. She ran for the door, but it had closed. Locked. The whispers grew louder, forming words:

"Welcome home, Clara. Your grandmother kept us waiting so long. But you're here now. You're finally here."

The lights went out, and in the darkness, Clara heard the sound of many voices, all whispering the same thing: "Stay. Stay. Stay."

She understood then. The house wasn't haunted. It was alive. And it was very, very hungry.`,

Then the storm hit.

It came from nowhere, a wall of white that swallowed the mountain whole. Jack had been descending when he heard it. A scream, cut short by the wind. His instincts screamed at him to keep moving, to save himself.

But that was Maria's voice.

He found her clinging to a rockface, her safety line severed, blood running down her face. Their eyes met, and in that moment, all the rivalry fell away. There was only survival.

"I've got you," Jack shouted over the wind, throwing her his rope.

For the next eighteen hours, they fought their way down the mountain together. Jack supported Maria's injured leg. Maria talked Jack through a panic attack when his oxygen ran low. They shared their last energy bar, their last sips of water, their fears and regrets.

When rescue finally found them, huddled in a tent at base camp, they were holding hands.

"I spent five years hating you," Maria said quietly, her voice hoarse from the cold.

Jack laughed, the sound raw and real. "Same. Seems pretty stupid now, doesn't it?"

"Incredibly stupid."

They sat in comfortable silence, watching the mountain that had tried to kill them. Some summits, they realized, had nothing to do with peaks. Some were about finding your way down, together, and being grateful for solid ground beneath your feet.`,

A volunteer from the audience would step into an ornate cabinet, and when Marcus opened it again. Nothing, empty. Then, seconds later, the volunteer would appear at the back of the theater, laughing and amazed.

Except now they weren't coming back.

It started three weeks ago. Sarah Mitchell, a teacher from Denver, had volunteered. She'd stepped into the cabinet, smiling nervously. Marcus performed his routine flawlessly. The cabinet was empty, just as it should be.

But Sarah never appeared at the back of the theater. She never appeared anywhere.

Marcus had canceled shows, spoken to police, hired private investigators. The cabinet was examined by engineers, there was no trap door, no hidden compartment. It was exactly what it appeared to be: a wooden box.

Tonight was his first show back. The theater was packed, morbid curiosity filling every seat. Marcus's hands shook as he asked for a volunteer.

A man in the third row raised his hand. Detective Chen, who'd been investigating Sarah's disappearance. Marcus's blood ran cold. Chen wanted answers, and he was willing to risk everything to get them.

As Chen stepped into the cabinet, Marcus whispered, "I'm sorry. I don't know what's happening."

"Then I guess we're about to find out together," Chen replied.

Marcus closed the cabinet door. Spoke the ancient words he'd learned from his mentor. Opened it.

Empty.

He turned to the back of the theater, praying to see Chen's face. But there was only darkness. And then, impossibly, he heard it. Voices, coming from inside the empty cabinet. Hundreds of them. Screaming.

Sarah's voice rose above the rest: "Marcus, where are we? Marcus, what did you DO?"

Some illusions, Marcus realized with growing horror, were never meant to be real.`,

I'm you, sixty years from now. I know that sounds impossible, but I need you to believe me. I need someone to remember, because I'm forgetting.

Today I forgot my daughter's name for ten whole minutes. I stood in my kitchen, looking at a photograph, and the word just wouldn't come. When it finally did, "Catherine". I cried so hard I couldn't breathe.

So I'm writing everything down. All the things I don't want to lose:

You marry Robert. You meet him at a bookstore on a rainy Tuesday. He makes a terrible joke about umbrellas, and you laugh anyway. You'll be married for forty-three years before his heart gives out. It's not enough time. It's never enough.

You have three children. Catherine, James, and little Sophie. Sophie becomes a doctor, just like she always said she would. I'm so proud, but sometimes I forget to tell her.

You buy a house on Maple Street with a garden full of roses. Every summer, you make raspberry jam that never quite sets properly, but your grandchildren love it anyway.

You make mistakes. You say things you don't mean. You miss opportunities and take wrong turns. But you also love fiercely, laugh often, and show up for the people who need you.

I'm writing this because soon I won't know who you are. Soon I'll be lost in a fog of forgotten moments, unable to piece together the story of our life. But right now, in this moment of clarity, I want you to know: we lived. We loved. We mattered.

Don't be afraid of the years ahead. They're beautiful, even the hard ones. Especially the hard ones.

And if you ever find yourself at eighty-three, sitting at a kitchen table trying to remember your own life, look for these letters. I'm hiding them everywhere. In books, in drawers, in coat pockets. Little pieces of us, scattered through time.

You are loved. Remember that, even when I can't.

With all my heart (while I still remember where to find it),
Margaret at Eighty-Three`,
